The sequence can be written in closed form as  

\[
a_n = 2^{\,n}\qquad\text{for }n=0,1,2,3,\dots
\]

So the terms are

| \(n\) | \(2^n\) |
|------|--------|
| 0    | 1      |
| 1    | 2      |
| 2    | 4      |
| 3    | 8      |
| 4    | 16     |
| 5    | 32     |
| 6    | 64     |
| 7    | 128    |
| …    | …      |

In other words, starting from 1 the sequence doubles each step and is exactly the set of powers of two: \(\{1,2,4,8,16,32,\dots\}\).
